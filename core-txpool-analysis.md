Txpool is mainly used to store the currently committed transactions waiting to be written to the block, both remote and local. Txlist is more on the heap structure.

There are two types of transactions in txpool.

1. Submitted but not yet executable, placed in the queue waiting to be executed (for example, nonce is too high).
2. Waiting for execution, put it in pending and wait for execution.

From the test case of txpool, the main functions of txpool are as follows.

1. The function of transaction verification, including insufficient balance, insufficient Gas, Nonce is too low, value is illegal, can not be negative.
2. Ability to cache transactions where Nonce is in a higher state than the current local account. Stored in the queue field. If it is a transaction that can be executed, it is stored in the pending field.
3. The same Nonce transaction for the same user will only retain the one with the largest GasPrice. Other inserts were unsuccessful.
4. If the account has no money, the transaction of the corresponding account in queue and pending will be deleted.
5. If the balance of the account is less than the amount of some transactions, the corresponding transaction will be deleted, and the valid transaction will be moved from pending to queue. Prevent being broadcast.
6. txPool supports some restrictions on PriceLimit (remove the lowest GasPrice limit), PriceBump (the percentage of the price of the transaction that replaces the same Nonce) AccountSlots (the minimum value of the pending slot for each account) GlobalSlots (the maximum value of the global pending queue) AccountQueue ( The minimum value of the queue for each account) GlobalQueue (maximum value of global queueing) Lifetime (the longest waiting time in the queue)
7. Replace with the priority of GasPrice in the case of limited resources.
8. Local transactions will be stored on disk using the journal's functionality and will be re-imported after reboot. Remote trading will not.

data structure

```go
// TxPool contains all currently known transactions. Transactions
// enter the pool when they are received from the network or submitted
// locally. They exit the pool when they are included in the blockchain.
// The pool separates processable transactions (which can be applied to the
// current state) and future transactions. Transactions move between those
// two states over time as they are received and processed.

	chainHeadSub event.Subscription

```go
// NewTxPool creates a new transaction pool to gather, sort and filter inbound
// trnsactions from the network.

The reset method retrieves the current state of the blockchain and ensures that the contents of the transaction pool are valid with respect to the current blockchain state. The main features include:

1. Because the block header was replaced, some transactions in the original block were invalidated due to the replacement of the block header. This part of the transaction needs to be re-added to the txPool to wait for the new block to be inserted.
2. Generate new currentState and pendingState
3. Move some of the transactions in pending to the queue
4. The transaction in the queue is moved into the pending.

demoteUnexecutables deletes invalid or processed transactions from pending, and other unexecutable transactions are moved to the future queue.

```go

enqueueTx inserts a new transaction into the future queue. This method assumes that the pool's lock has been acquired.

```go
// enqueueTx inserts a new transaction into the non-executable transaction queue.

The promoteExecutables method inserts transactions that have become executable from the future queue into the pending queue. Through this process, all invalid transactions (nonce too low, insufficient balance) will be deleted.

```go

Loop is a goroutine of txPool. It is also the main event loop. Waiting and responding to external blockchain events and various report and transaction eviction events.

	defer journal.Stop()

	// Track the previous head headers for transaction reorgs
	head := pool.chain.CurrentBlock()

The add method, validates the transaction and inserts it into the future queue. If the transaction replaces a currently existing transaction, it returns the previous transaction so that the external method does not call the promote method. If a newly added transaction is Marked as local, then its sending account will enter the white list, the associated transaction of this account will not be deleted due to price restrictions or other restrictions.

```go
// add validates a transaction and inserts it into the non-executable queue for
// later pending promotion and execution. If the transaction is a replacement for
// an already pending or queued one, it overwrites the previous and returns this
// so outer code doesn't uselessly call promote.
//
// If a newly added transaction is marked as local, its sending account will be
// whitelisted, preventing any associated transaction from being dropped out of
// the pool due to pricing constraints.

validateTx uses consistency rules to check if a transaction is valid and uses some heuristic restrictions on the local node.
